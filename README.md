# mech-turk-tasks

## 
An ipython notebook and supporting modules for performing annotation tasks using amazon mechanical turk.

### Notable requirements

- requests
- boto
- pdfminer
- email
- jsonschema


###Python compatibility
The boto modules that interact with mech-turk haven't been ported to python3 yet. As a result, everything here is only 
compatible with python 2.7.
